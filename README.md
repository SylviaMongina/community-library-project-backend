# PHASE 3 PROJECT
# Author : Sylvia Bosire 18-02-2023
### Project Focus üéØ
Building a Sinatra API backend that uses Active Record to access and persist data in a database, which will be used by a separate React frontend that interacts with the database via the API.

## Learning Goals üë®‚ÄçüöÄ

- Use Active Record to interact with a database.
- Have a minimum of two models with a one-to-many relationship.
- Create API routes in Sinatra that handles at least three different CRUD actions for at least one of your Active Record models.
- Build a separate React frontend application that interacts with the API to perform CRUD actions.
- Use good OO design patterns. You should have separate classes for each of your models, and create instance and class methods as necessary.

## Backend Setup ‚ú¥Ô∏è

- [x] Clone the repository using `https://github.com/SylviaMongina/community-library-project-backend.git` or download and extract the zip file.
- [x] Open up the cloned folder in your preferred text editor. Open up a terminal within your workspace and navigate into the  community-library-project-backend folder
- [x] Within that folder `community-library-project-backend`, run `npm install` which will install all dependencies for the project and then run `npm start` to get our application running on `http://localhost:3000/`

## Frontend Setup ‚ú¥Ô∏è
- [x] cd into blog-client folder and run `bundle install` from your terminal which will install all the gems 
- [x] seed the database with data using cmd `bundle exec rake db:seed` or alternatively you can use `bundle exec rake db:seed:replant` to delete everything in the database and seed it with data to be fetched by an API
- [x] Finally run `bundle exec rake server` to keep your backend running on `http://localhost:9292` :boom:
